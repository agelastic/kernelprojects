Random toy mods to Linux kernel

From the times when I picked at the kernel a tiny bit. Related to the [Eudyptula challenge](https://github.com/agelastic/eudyptula/). IIRC this whole enterprise resulted in some [increased knowledge](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&q=Vitaly+Osipov)!
